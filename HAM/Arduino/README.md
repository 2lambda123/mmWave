# mmWave-HAM (High Accuracy Measurement)
This repository contains the Batman Kit- HAM mmWave Sensor SDK. 
The High Accuracy Measurement (HAM) based Batman Kit is for measuring object distance 
from the mmWave Sensor Module with the range of 0.3 ~ 3.0 meters(about 1 ~ 10 feet) with millimeter accuracy.

# Installing:
 (1) Hardware:
 
     - See Drawing connection for more detail 
     
     - Connect mmWave Batman-BT101 to Arduino DUE
     
     - Connect 6 MATRIX LEDs 
       
 
 (2) Firmware:
     - Download program codes (On Going)
      
      
# Notes: 
   1. The mmWave jumper should be selected for KEY Data Mode with baud rate 115200/8/n/1
