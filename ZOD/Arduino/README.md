mmWave SDK examples based on Batman Kit mmWave Sensor module

# mmWave

This repository contains Batman mmWave-ZOD Zone Occupancy Detection mmWave Sensor SDK. The sample code below consists of instruction for using the mmWave lib. This mmWave-ZOD C Program will work with Zone Occupancy Detection (ZOD) based Batman BM201-ZOD mmWave Kit solution. This sample program works with an Arduino Dual + LED Matrix Boards along with Batman BM201-ZOD Kit, for detecting a Target moving from Zone-1 to/from Zone-2; where Zone-1 is located approx. 1meter to 1.3meter distance from the center of the mmWave Module, and with +/- 7.5dgree Azimuth from the center of the mmWave Module; and where Zone-2 is located approx. 2meter to 2.3meter distance from the center of the mmWave Module, and with +/- 7.5dgree Azimuth from the center of the mmWave Module.  In addition, this program provide a Counter for Zone-1 to Zone-2 movement, and another Counter for Zone-2 to Zone-1 movement, for differentiating direction movement.
